How to Interpret "Outflow Since Last Salary"

This value represents the total cash leaving the checking account between paychecks. This is based on a specific Catergory ID.
Only negative transactions (withdrawals and transfers out) are included.

All data is presented for the chosen account for verification purposes.
Deposits other than salary are intentionally ignored
Transfers into the account are ignored
The value is shown on each salary transaction row

Practical use:
The largest value in this column over time is a strong indicator of the minimum checking account balance needed to safely cover expenses between paychecks.

How to modify:
Make sure the ACCOUNTID in the SQL and Lua is correct (e.g. your checking account - default 44).
Make sure the CATEDIG in the Lua is correct (e.g. salary - defaultt 69).
